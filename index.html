    <h1>Our Valentine</h1>
    <p>Our Valentine was never meant to be just one single day filled with roses or chocolates. It slowly became something deeper, something that lives in our everyday moments  in late night talks that feel endless, in soft good mornings that feel like sunlight touching the heart, and in the quiet comfort of knowing that no matter how loud the world gets, we still have our own peaceful little universe. Loving you has turned ordinary time into glowing memories, and this Valentine feels less like a celebration and more like a promise that we chose each other gently, sincerely, and without hesitation.</p>

    <h1>Your Smile</h1>
    <p>Your smile holds a kind of magic that words can never fully explain. It isn’t just beautiful to look at  it feels warm, safe, and full of hope, like everything will somehow be okay. When you smile at me, the world pauses for a second, just long enough for me to realize how lucky I am to have you in my life. There is softness in that smile that reaches straight into my heart and settles there quietly, reminding me that happiness can be simple just you, looking at me, smiling for no reason at all.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="page" onclick="nextPage()">
    <img class="bg" src="day12.jpg" />
    <h1>In Your Arms</h1>
    <p>Being in your arms feels like the safest place that could ever exist. The noise fades, the chaos disappears, and every worry loses its meaning the moment you hold me close. Time slows down there, letting me breathe, letting me feel peace I didn’t even know I was searching for. Your embrace isn’t loud or dramatic — it is calm, warm, and certain, like a silent promise that I am exactly where I belong. And in that quiet space between your heartbeat and mine, I find a love that makes me never want to let go.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="page" onclick="nextPage()">
    <img class="bg" src="day15.jpg" />
    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>Our story, the story of Catman and Batwoman, was never about grand heroic moments. It was built slowly through small, meaningful things learning each other’s silences, laughing at the smallest jokes, healing doubts, choosing honesty, and growing together day by day. These eight months may seem small to the world, but to me they feel like full chapters of trust, patience, and something beautifully real. What we share isn’t just excitement; it is calm, healthy, steady love… the kind that is worth protecting every single day.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="page" onclick="nextPage()">
    <img class="bg" src="day18.jpg" />
    <h1>Forever</h1>
    <p>Forever with you doesn’t feel like a distant dream; it feels like a quiet certainty resting gently inside my heart. I don’t imagine perfection — I imagine real life with you: shared laughter, silly arguments that end in hugs, growing older while still looking at each other with the same softness we have today. Forever means choosing you in every season, every mood, every version of life that comes our way. Because forever was never really about time… it was always about us, still together, still in love, even as everything else changes.</p>

    <h1 class="glow-name">Batwoman</h1>

    <p>
      Not just today… not just tomorrow…
      <br><br>
      I choose you in every lifetime,
      every universe,
      every version of forever.
      <br><br>
      And today… I have only one question in my heart.
